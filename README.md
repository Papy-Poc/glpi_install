 ![Image](https://glpi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hero-img-2.png)

## About this script

### Latest version of GLPI : 10.0.17

This script was written to quickly and automatically install the latest version of GLPI on Ubuntu, Debian, Alma Linux, Centos, Rocky Linux and Red Hat servers.

## Distribution and Web server

| OS | VERSION | COMPATIBILITY | WEB SERVER |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Debian|11|✅|Apache|
|Debian|12|✅|Apache|
|Ubuntu|23.10|✅|Apache|
|Ubuntu|24.10|⚠️ A tester|Apache|
|Alma Linux|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Centos|9|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Rocky Linux|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Red Hat|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|

The script will update the host system and install the Web server, MariaDB, PHP and dependencies, download and install the latest version from the [GLPI Official Repository](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi) and configure the database for you.

Once the script has run, all you need to do is connect to GLPI.

GLPI is installed without SSL. If you need to open access to GLPI from the outside and/or an SSL certificate, I recommend using a reverse proxy.
