 ![Image](https://glpi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hero-img-2.png)

## About this script

### Latest version of GLPI : 10.0.17

This script was written to quickly and automatically install the latest version of GLPI on Ubuntu, Debian, Alma Linux, Centos, Rocky Linux and Red Hat servers.
The installer analyzes the distribution's locale information to propose the default installation language.

## Distribution and Web server

| OS | VERSION | COMPATIBILITY | WEB SERVER |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Debian|11|✅|Apache|
|Debian|12|✅|Apache|
|Ubuntu|23.10|✅|Apache|
|Ubuntu|24.10|⚠️ A tester|Apache|
|Alma Linux|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Centos|9|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Rocky Linux|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|
|Red Hat|9.5|✅|Engine X (Nginx)|

The script will automate the update of the system, the installation of a web server (Apache or Nginx), a MariaDB database, and PHP, as well as their dependencies. It will perform the download and installation of the latest version of GLPI from the [official repository](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi) and finalize by configuring the database.

Once the script has run, all you need to do is connect to GLPI.

GLPI is installed without SSL. If you need to open access to GLPI from the outside and/or an SSL certificate, I recommend using a reverse proxy.
